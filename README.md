# RuneKit

The missing pieces of the SvelteKit developer experience.

### stuff I want to build in this

- Signal tracing in UI (similar to react scan)
- Page stats viewer: is it pre-rendering? is it static? ssr? csr? etc.
- Endpoint list viewer: all the endpoints, pages, and remote functions in the app
- Signal breakdown viewer: see all the signals mounted on a page at a glance, and when they're fired + their history
